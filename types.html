                a pre-loaded operating system.The operating system is not set 
                in stone, more often than not users change to one of the
                following: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X,
                and Linux.

                <br> Mac OS X is an operating system that was created by the well known brand of cell 
                phones, none other than Apple. This software can be found in Macintosh computers(Macs).

                <br> Linux is an open-source operating system, that can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world.
                Seeing as it is not a proprietary software like the ones mentioned above, this allows for it modification by anyone
                not just one particular company.
